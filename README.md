# Moovy: Mobile App

# 1. Description

This project was developed in 1 week as a response to the challenge proposed by _Tarken_.
It consists of a movie platform where the user can search and add to their library. Then, using the application (developed in react-native and also part of the challenge), the user can record an audio review for each book in their library.

# 2. Dependencies

Make sure you have Yarn and Expo installed:

- Yarn (I’m using v1.22.18)
- Expo(I’m using v5.4.3)

# 3. Running with Yarn

1. In the root folder, **install the dependencies** using the command:

```docker
$ yarn
```

2. Run de following command to start the application:

```docker

3. You can use the Expo Go app in your android phone to run the application. Just scan the generated qr code.

If you want to change the backend server URL you can do it in _/tarken-challenge-fullstack-mobile/utils/api.ts_ in the _API_URL_ constant.
